# NewExpertiseGroup
Researching and implementing modern web frontend and backend tech proof-of-concept style AMAP with a buddy

## Contents

This repository is going to contain various web frontend and backend implementations for learning purposes. It is a collection of project collections because of the goal of implementing various reference web technology implementations with as many different and relevant as possible. For example, one implementation with Node.js and another Django. It is useful to learn the differences between different technologies in such an obvious, reference implementation way.

## Project templates

Templates are implemented as uniquely-named, parallel directories to and in contrast to the inner 'newexpertisegroup' one where those template impl can be collectively run and tested in a combined way. There is also a separate 'test' sub-sub-directory that might or might not be used. This structuring is mostly because of how python manages packages and their internal scope of visibility.
